# LoRa P2P Gateway with Relay & Metering Support
I have designed a gateway developed to collect and process data from multiple end-nodes using LoRa P2P communication. The gateway includes hardware support for actuation and metering, and is suitable for IoT deployments such as smart buildings or utilities monitoring.

## Features
1. LoRa P2P communication to receive data from multiple distributed end-nodes
2. Two onboard relays for switching external loads
3. Four wired pulse inputs for reading standard utility meters
4. Support for one encoded water meter
5. RS-485 interface for industrial communication or Modbus-compatible devices
6. USB C for flashing code and Serial Communication

## Hardware Details
1. Complete schematic design and component selection
2. Custom PCB layout and routing
3. Designed for reliable embedded control and long-range communication

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. Hardware design using Altium
2. LoRa for wireless data transfer
3. RS-485 and pulse inputs for metering interfaces
4. Optional firmware stack to be added depending on application

## Project Scope
This is developed for deployment by Live Building Systems
Schematic diagrams, PCB files, and other technical details are confidential and proprietary to Live Building Systems.
